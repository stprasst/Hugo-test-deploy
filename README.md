# Deployment API Server

This server was automatically generated by CuanApps to receive exported files.

## How to Run

1. Make sure Go is installed on your server (minimum version 1.16)
2. Upload all files in this folder to your server
3. Run the server with the command:

   ```
   go run main.go
   ```

   Or build it first:

   ```
   go build -o deployment-server
   ./deployment-server
   ```

4. The server will run on port 8080

## Configuration

You can modify the configuration in config.json:

- deployment_path: Path to store received files
- port: HTTP server port
- allowed_origins: Domains allowed for CORS (use * for all)
- log_path: Path for log files

## Endpoints
